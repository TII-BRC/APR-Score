Welcome to APR-Score, a relaible tool for screening the potential aggregation prone regions in protein sequences! 
This README file aims to provide you with essential information about the APR-Score, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and licensing details.

###### ****** Installation  ****** ######

	I. 	Download the installation package from https://github.com/TII-BRC/APR-Score
	II.	Based on your preference you may select ScikitLearn (for commandline interface) or Orange Datamining (for graphical interface) to run the prediction from trained models. 

###### ****** Usage  ****** ######

APR-Score is designed to identify the potential aggregation prone regions in the protein sequences. 

###### ****** System Requirements  ****** ######

Before running APR-Score, ensure that your system meets the following minimum requirements:

		Operating System: Linux (preferred) or Windows
		Processor: APR-Score runs with the pretrained models and do not require any high end processor for execution.
		RAM: For graphic user interface (GUI), user may check the requirements for Orange Datamining.
		Disk Space: For a protein sequence (length ~ 300 amino acid residues), APR-Score generates a preprocessing and prediction data of about 10-20 Mbs.

####### ****** Repository File Information ****** #########
APR-Score is highly efficient and reliable methodology for prediction of aggregation prone regions in protein sequences.The methodology integrates physico-chemical and structural chemical and secondary structural features of amino acids triplets. T
he purposed methodology is thoroughly validated on the experimentally characterized aggregation forming proteinswith a sizably high accuracy then previously purposed approaches.
This directory APR-Score in this repository is consist of machine learning based trained models as follows:
1. APR_LR.pkcls
   Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using logistic regression. This is reported as APR-Score-LR in the manuscript. 
 
2. APR_RF.pkcls
  Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using random forest. This is reported as APR-Score-RF in the manuscript.

3. APR_SVM.pkcls
    Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using support vector machine. This is reported as APR-Score-SVM in the manuscript.

4. APR_NN.pkcls
  Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using neural network. This is reported as APR-Score-NN in the manuscript.

5.APR_GB.pkcls
  Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using gradient boost. This is reported as APR-Score-GB in the manuscript.

6. APR_Meta.pkcls
 Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using an integrated (stacked) prediction model of APR-Score-LR, APR-Score-RF, APR-Score-SVM, APR-Score-NN, APR-Score-GB. 
 This is reported as APR-Score-Meta in the manuscript.
