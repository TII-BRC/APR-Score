APR-Score is highly efficient and reliable methodology for prediction of aggregation prone regions in protein sequences.The methodology integrates physico-chemical and structural chemical and secondary structural features of amino acids triplets. The purposed methodology is thoroughly validated on the experimentally characterized aggregation forming proteinswith a sizably high accuracy then previously purposed approaches.
This directory APR-Score in this repository is consist of machine learning based trained models as follows:

1. APR_LR.pkcls
   Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using logistic regression. This is reported as APR-Score-LR in the manuscript. 
 
2. APR_RF.pkcls
  Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using random forest. This is reported as APR-Score-FR in the manuscript.

3. APR_SVM.pkcls
    Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using support vector machine. This is reported as APR-Score-SVM in the manuscript.

4. APR_NN.pkcls
  Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using neural network. This is reported as APR-Score-NN in the manuscript.

5.APR_GB.pkcls
  Aggregation prone region scoring and identification using gradient boost. This is reported as APR-Score-GB in the manuscript.

Among the above prediction models, the random forest based trained model performed marginally better than other models.
